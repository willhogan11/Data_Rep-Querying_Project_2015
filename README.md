## Data Representation and Querying Project 2015
### Created by: Will Hogan

## Overview
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "galway-city-playground-locations" which is available at this URL: [data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-playground-locations). 
To summarise, i have created an API which Allows developers to connect and retrieve information from the above URL. The details i feel will be extremely useful as it outlines playground locations in the Galway City **_or_ (tbc)** / county areas in Ireland.
